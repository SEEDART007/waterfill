# Water Filling Timer

There is a major problem here when i look around and its not a small problem...here(in india) most of the people use to fill their household water tanks using a pump which extracts water from ground...but when the water tank gets fill the people just forgets to switch off the water pump and water flows out and out and thats a heavy wastage of fresh water....

Our application will reduce such kind of water wastage....our application will take the volume of the tanker and the inflow rate of water as an input and estimate an approximate time which is needed to fill the water, after that you can start the timer....after the timer gets over an alarm will ring and you can stop the alarm and switchoff the water pump which will reduce the water wastage...
